    "When I was 14, I watched my uncle struggle with smoking. He tried everything—patches, gum, willpower—but nothing worked. At 52, he died from lung cancer, leaving behind a family who loved him.",
    "That loss never left me. As a professional athlete, I learned that lasting change doesn't come from willpower alone. It comes from understanding the science, having the right support, and taking it one step at a time.",
    "Smart Nicotine was born from that belief. This isn't about judgment or quick fixes. It's about giving you the tools, knowledge, and support to break free—permanently. And it's completely free, because everyone deserves a fighting chance.",
